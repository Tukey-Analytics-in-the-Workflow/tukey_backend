# Tukey 🧠📊

AI-powered Decision Intelligence Platform for POS-driven Retail Businesses

Tukey converts raw Point-of-Sale (POS) data into **actionable business decisions**, not just dashboards.
It combines **FastAPI**, **Tableau embedded analytics**, and **LLM-powered decision intelligence** to help retailers answer questions like:

- What should I stock next?
- Which product will be profitable next season?
- Which customer segment should I target?

---

## 🚀 Features (MVP)

✅ POS data ingestion (CSV / JSON)
✅ Tableau-powered analytics dashboards
✅ Seasonal, product-wise, and demographic insights
✅ Predictive analytics (Tableau Forecast / TabPy-ready)
✅ **LLM-based business decision Q&A (core differentiator)**
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
✅ Secure dashboard embedding

## 🏗️ System Architecture

    v                      v
Tableau Cloud          LLM API
```

**Why this matters:**
- Analytics stay in Tableau (best-in-class BI)
- Decisions happen via AI (context + reasoning)
- Backend enforces security, RBAC, and auditability

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin / Analyst / Viewer)
- All analytics and AI endpoints are protected
- Designed to map cleanly to Tableau Groups later

---

## 📦 POS Data Ingestion

### Upload POS Data

```http
POST /pos/upload
```

**Supported formats**
- CSV (MVP)
- JSON (MVP)
- Tableau Hyper Extracts (future)

**Use cases**
- Power Tableau dashboards
- Feed analytics context to LLMs
- Enable forecasting

---

## 📊 Tableau Integration

Tukey integrates with Tableau using:

- **Tableau REST API** – publish & manage content
- **Embedding API** – embed dashboards inside SaaS UI
- **Hyper API** – optimized analytics ingestion
- **TabPy** (optional) – Python-based forecasting

Dashboards are embedded RBAC-aware, ensuring users only see what they are permitted to.

---

## 🧠 LLM Decision Intelligence (Core Feature)

Tukey does not stop at dashboards.

### Example Question

> "Should I restock winter jackets?"

### LLM Input (Generated by Backend)

```json
{
  "time_period": "Winter",
  "region": "Delhi",
  "top_products": ["Jackets", "Sweaters"],
  "sales_trend": "Increasing"
}
```

### LLM Output

```json
{
  "decision": "Stock winter jackets",
  "confidence": "High",
  "reason": "Consistent YoY growth during winter season"
}
```

This is the **hackathon differentiator**:
> Analytics → Context → Decision

---

## 🤖 AI Decision Endpoint

```http
POST /ai/decision
```

**Returns**
- Decision
- Reasoning
- Confidence score (optional)

---

## 📈 Predictive Analytics

**Supported options:**
- Tableau built-in forecasting (MVP preferred)
- TabPy Python models (advanced)
- Future ML pipelines

**Forecast outputs can be:**
- Visualized in Tableau
- Used as AI context
- Logged for auditability
